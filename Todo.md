1. **Detailed Error Messages for Database Operations**: 
   - Provided specific error messages for certain database-related errors, but the code can still benefit from more specific error handling based on different database error types.

2. **More Structured Logging with Log Levels**: 
   - The current code uses basic logging; structured logging with different levels (info, error, debug, etc.) would be beneficial.

3. **Handle JWT Token Expiry Gracefully**: 
   The JWT token does have an expiry set, but there's no logic to handle token expiry and refresh in the current code.

4. **Handle Multiple Database Errors**: 
   - Specific error handling was added for a situation where a username conflict might arise during registration. However, more specific error handling based on different database error types would be beneficial.

5. **JWT Key Security:**
    - Using Kubernetes secrets is a good start, but consider using a more secure system for managing secrets in production, such as HashiCorp's Vault.

6. **JWT Token Expiry:**
    - You've set the JWT token to expire in 24 hours. Depending on your application's needs, you might want to have shorter-lived access tokens and introduce a refresh token mechanism.

7. **SQL Queries:**
    - Your SQL queries are straightforward, but as your application grows, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for better maintainability and security.

8. **HTTP Status Codes:**
    - When a user tries to register with an already existing username, it might be beneficial to return a `409 Conflict` status code instead of a `500 Internal Server Error`.

9. **Middleware:**
    - Consider using middleware for tasks such as logging, CORS handling, and authentication. This will make your main application logic cleaner.

10. **Configuration Management:**
    - Right now, some configurations, like the database connection string, are hardcoded. In a larger application, consider using a configuration management tool or library.

11. **Ping Database:**
    - In `init_db`, you're pinging the database immediately after opening a connection. It's good for an initial check, but consider having a health check endpoint which periodically checks the health of your services, including the database.
