## General Improvements


### Logging & Monitoring
- Implement structured logging with different log levels (info, error, debug, etc.).
- Integrate with monitoring tools for database metrics.
- Use monitoring tools for database performance metrics and set up alerts for unusual activities.

### Security
- Improve JWT key security. (Use some sort of vault).
- Use prepared statements everywhere to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Review database security settings, ensure limited open ports, and consider encryption for sensitive data.

### Token Management
- Handle JWT token expiry. Consider shorter-lived access tokens and a refresh token mechanism.

### API & Middleware
- Consider rate limiting on API endpoints.
- Implement middleware for tasks like logging, CORS handling, and authentication.

### Configuration & Deployment
- Ensure that database configurations are optimized for each environment (development, staging, production).

### Database

#### General
- Move to an ORM for maintainability and security.
- Plan/scripts for regular backups of the database and test the restoration process.

#### Performance & Scalability
- Implement caching mechanisms, like Redis, for frequently accessed data.
- Review queries and add optimized indexes to frequently searched columns.
- Partitioning large tables like `transactions` for more efficient querying.
- Evaluate database connection pooling libraries for better performance.
- Sharding the database by `user_id` for scalability.

#### Design & Structure
- Review the database schema for normalization.
- Database partitioning for managing large datasets efficiently.
- Database migration tool for schema evolution.

#### Operations & Maintenance
- Implement a health check endpoint for periodic service health checks, including the database.
- Archiving old or seldom-used data for a leaner database.
- Balancing use of transactions to ensure data integrity without harming performance.

#### Error Handling & Feedback
- Structured and informative error feedback.
- Implement comprehensive error handling in DB operations.
- Define and monitor SLAs for database performance and uptime.

### Authentication Refactoring with Authboss

1. **Research & Setup**:
    - Familiarize yourself with the Authboss documentation and its features.
    - Set up Authboss in the project: Install the necessary packages and dependencies.
    
2. **Refactor `auth.go`**:
    - Remove the custom JWT implementation and any other custom authentication logic.
    - Implement Authboss's authentication mechanisms, including:
        - Registration
        - Login
        - Logout
        - Session management
        - Optional: Refresh tokens (if deemed necessary)
        
3. **Database Integration**:
    - Modify the database models and queries to align with Authboss's expected structures and interfaces.
    
4. **Middlewares & Routes**:
    - Integrate Authboss middlewares into the Gin routing system to handle authentication checks and redirections.
    - Ensure that existing routes are protected by the Authboss authentication middleware where needed.
    
5. **Testing**:
    - Update or create new tests to ensure the Authboss implementation works as expected.
    - Test edge cases, such as failed logins, expired sessions, etc.
6. **Deployment Considerations**:
    - If deploying, ensure any Authboss configurations, especially secrets or keys, are securely managed in the production environment.

### High priority items

### Must Have:
1. **Validation Middleware:** Validate request payloads to ensure data integrity.
2. **Authentication & Authorization Middleware:** Ensure secure access to your API.
3. **Error Handling:** Implement a consistent error handler for your API responses.
4. **Config Management:** Fetch sensitive information from environment variables or a secure configuration system.
5. **Database Migrations Tool:** Manage database schema changes and migrations.
6. **Health Check Endpoint:** Ensure your service's health can be monitored.
7. **API Versioning:** Protect users from breaking changes by versioning the API.
8. **Backup & Recovery:** Implement a system for regular data backups and a clear recovery plan.
9. **Graceful Shutdown:** Handle service interruptions by finishing tasks and releasing resources properly.
10. **Logging:** Log important events, errors, and other relevant information.

### Should Have:
1. **Rate Limiting & Throttling Middleware:** Protect the API from abuse and manage user requests effectively.
2. **Caching:** Improve performance by caching frequently accessed data.
3. **Metrics & Monitoring Middleware:** Collect metrics for analysis and visualization.
4. **Request ID Middleware:** Aid debugging and tracking with unique IDs for each request.
5. **Content Negotiation:** Support multiple response formats based on client requirements.
6. **Compression Middleware:** Reduce API response payload sizes for faster transmission.
7. **Secure Sensitive Routes:** Enhance protection for routes that modify data or configurations.

### Good to Have:
1. **Documentation:** Use tools like Swagger to auto-generate API documentation.
2. **CORS Middleware:** Handle cross-origin requests if your backend serves multiple frontends.
3. **Performance Profiling Tools:** Integrate tools that can help profile and optimize your API's performance.
4. **Backup Rotation and Archival:** Implement a rotation system for backups and archive older backups.
5. **Feedback and Logging Mechanism for Clients:** Allow clients/users to send feedback or errors directly through the API.

Remember, while the "Must Have" features are fundamental for any production-ready application, the items in "Should Have" and "Good to Have" can elevate the quality, performance, and user experience of your application. Depending on your application's specific requirements, you might need to shuffle some items among these categories.
