# TODO

## General Improvements

### Error Handling
- Provide detailed error messages for database operations.
- Handle JWT token expiry gracefully.
- Implement more specific error handling for different database error types.

### Logging & Monitoring
- Implement structured logging with different log levels (info, error, debug, etc.).
- Integrate with monitoring tools for database metrics.
- Use monitoring tools for database performance metrics and set up alerts for unusual activities.

### Security
- Improve JWT key security. Consider solutions like HashiCorp's Vault.
- Use prepared statements everywhere to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Regularly review database security settings, ensure limited open ports, and consider encryption for sensitive data.

### Token Management
- Handle JWT token expiry. Consider shorter-lived access tokens and a refresh token mechanism.

### API & Middleware
- Consider rate limiting on API endpoints.
- Implement middleware for tasks like logging, CORS handling, and authentication.

### Configuration & Deployment
- Move hardcoded configurations like database connection strings to environment variables or configuration files.
- Ensure that database configurations are optimized for each environment (development, staging, production).

### Database

#### General
- Consider using an ORM for maintainability and security.
- Regularly update and patch the database software and libraries.
- Ensure regular backups of the database and test the restoration process.

#### Performance & Scalability
- Implement caching mechanisms, like Redis, for frequently accessed data.
- Regularly review queries and add optimized indexes to frequently searched columns.
- Consider partitioning large tables like `transactions` for more efficient querying.
- Evaluate database connection pooling libraries for better performance.
- Consider sharding the database by `user_id` for scalability.

#### Design & Structure
- Review the database schema for normalization.
- Consider database partitioning for managing large datasets efficiently.
- Ensure table and column names follow a consistent naming convention.
- Consider using a database migration tool for schema evolution.

#### Operations & Maintenance
- Implement a health check endpoint for periodic service health checks, including the database.
- Consider archiving old or seldom-used data for a leaner database.
- Use transactions judiciously to ensure data integrity without harming performance.

#### Error Handling & Feedback
- Provide structured and informative error feedback.
- Implement comprehensive error handling in DB operations.
- Define and monitor SLAs for database performance and uptime.
